# Description

This project is according to Josh Long's talk on the MicroXChg 2016 about Microservice built with Spring Cloud and Boot.
In order to have a learning effect, i did not just copy'n'paste his code from his Github rep, but tried to implement it by myself but with Josh's project as template.

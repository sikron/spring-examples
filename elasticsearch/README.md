# Description

This project is about how Spring Data supports Elasticsearch. There only exists a implementation module, which implements the interface of the `jpa` sibling project.

# Purpose

* How good does Spring support Elasticsearch?
* can/should the JPA approach be used or maybe better the native Elasticsearch clients?

# Requirements

* a Elasticsearch Server on localhost and port 9300 (see `elasticsearch.properties`)

# What can it do?

* execute the tests in `com.skronawi.spring.examples.elasticsearch.impl.DataTest`

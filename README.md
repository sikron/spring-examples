# Description

This is just a collection of individual Spring try-outs. The goal is to have basic understanding of several aspects of 
Spring - mainly those relevant for web development. Those aspects can be found e.g. at https://start.spring.io/

In order to gain deeper understanding, the projects should not use the Spring Boot stuff, but the basic Spring stuff.

All projects have corresponding `README.md` files with further infos.
